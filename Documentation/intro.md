# Unreal Engine 4 compared to Unity

For this school course I've investigated the differences between Unreal Engine 4 and Unity engine 5.
This comparison will mostly focus on the following things.

* The graphical options of Unreal Engine and Unity.
* The development of VR applications within the engines.
* Comparing the way of programming.
* Comparing the physics features of both engines.

As a start, the graphical features of both engines will be compared.
