## Graphics

In any game engine to graphics are arguably the most important feature, this is what the users will see.
People can't play your game when they aren't shown something, simple enough.

Both engines feature very advanced graphical capabilities, this is seen the examples below.

I'm not (yet) able to produce graphics like this, so will focus on more basic examples.

#### Materials

Both engines use so called 'materials' to apply a look to objects. 
The engines share material variables, such as a base color, metallic parameter and roughness variable.
Materials also can contain textures, which can be used for looks, normal maps and other effects.
