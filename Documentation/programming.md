## Programming

When making a VR experience, programming is an important part of the experience.
Without some programming, the only thing that can be done is maybe looking around or at one object without interaction.
Programming your experience can be done by C++ in Unreal Engine and C# in Unity, Unreal Engine 4 also includes a visual programming plugin called Blueprint.

#### Unreal engine
Programming in UE4 gives you the option to use blueprint, or C++ with custom features like macros.
Blueprint is made for simplicity, by connecting nodes together you can program small games and simple demo's.
When programming a bigger application, you'll likely need C++ for something.
